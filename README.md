# MedTrust – Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Records System

**MedTrust** is a secure, blockchain-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) management system. It allows patients and healthcare providers to store, share, and manage medical records safely using smart contracts and decentralized technologies. The platform puts control of health data into the hands of the patient, promoting transparency, trust, and accessibility.
